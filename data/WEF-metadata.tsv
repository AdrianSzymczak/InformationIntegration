pctpatentapplpc	PCT patents, applications/million pop.*	Number of applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) per million population	2010-2011 average	Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), [i]Patent Database[i], (situation as of June 2014); For population: International Monetary Fund,[i]World Economic Outlook Database[i] (April 2014 edition); World Economic Forum's calculations. For more details about the treatment of Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan (China), refer to the section "Technical Notes and Sources".	This indicator measures the total count of applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), by priority date and inventor nationality, using fractional count if an application is filed by multiple inventors. The average count of applications filed in 2009 and 2010 is divided by population figures for 2010.  For Taiwan (China) and Hong Kong SAR, two advanced economies, we use estimates in the absence of reliable data on PCT applications. First, we compute the average number of all patent applications filed with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO) in 2009–10. We then compute the average number of PCT applications for 2009 and 2010, before computing the ratio of the two averages (1.56). Only economies with a two-year average number of at least 100 USPTO applications and 50 PCT are considered for the computation of the two averages, and Taiwan (China) and Hong Kong SAR are excluded. We then divide the number of applications filed by Taiwan and Hong Kong residents, respectively, by the ratio above in order to produce an estimate for PCT applications. As a final step, we compute the estimates per million population—that is, 537.5 for Taiwan (China) and 85.3 for Hong Kong SAR. The estimates are used to compute the respective Innovation pillar score of the two economies.	Indicator
